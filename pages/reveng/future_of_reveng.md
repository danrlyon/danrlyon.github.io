# The Future of Reverse Engineering
Much work is being done to improve and simplify our reverse engineering tools while simultaneously other tools are being created to better hide our software from reverse engineers. It is hard to know where we go from here, but it is clear that there are still many exciting challenges and prospective solutions.


## Trends in Software Reverse Engineering
Reverse engineering has evolved a lot since the 1990s: there are more programming languages than ever, the underlying techniques to reverse engineer software, and even the output notation has changed. Early on, many of the software engineering techniques were parsing-based and focused on C/C++ or COBOL. Over time this changed as Java became more popular and programmers developed more visual tools. Engineers were able to use these tools to produce code traces or concept lattices. 

The study done by Dr. Rehman Arshad showed that in general, "reverse engineering is moving from code comprehension and graphs towards components and architectural notations." [1]
