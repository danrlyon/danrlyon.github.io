# The History of Reverse Engineering
For as long as humans have been innovating, the most curious among us have been seeking to understand the inner workings of inventions. Take your access to the available data, concepts, or even physical structures and use that to discover how something works. It used to be simpler to do and it gets more challenging every day. 

A famous case of early reverse engineering would be when Galileo simply heard about a telescope and from that figured out how to make one. The original inventor of the telescope, or at least the first to file a patent for it, was the Dutch eyeglass maker, Hans Lipperhey, who submitted his patent in 1608 [2]. But it wasn’t until it was in the hands of other curious inventors who took their understanding of how it worked and improved it so that it could be used in many different applications.

This example with Galileo is a demonstration of reverse engineering in a competitive sense. Take someone’s invention and figure it out just so that you can make your own, and possibly better, version. This has been a common practice throughout history and these days we have strict rules in place that make this more difficult, but not impossible. Now it is common to reverse engineer a competitor’s product and come up with a way to achieve the same results without infringing on their patent.

But of course reverse engineering has had more than just business uses. In war times it has always been common to try to figure out the weaponry of the adversary. Back in the early days of handheld weapons, a battle could be decided by whose armor was the strongest or whose blade was the sharpest. If you could acquire your opponent’s weapon and figure out how to replicate it, or even what its weakness is, you would gain a significant advantage on the battlefield. 

A more recent example of wartime reverse engineering was in World War II when the United States developed a bomber airplane that was so advanced that it revolutionized engineering, aerodynamics, manufacturing, and electronics[3]. I’m talking about the U.S. Aircraft, the B-29 Superfortress.
 
The B-29 was developed and built in the 1940s and it was first used on June 5th, 1944 in a raid on Bangkok. The Russians were already aware of the B-29, but had instead been focusing their manufacturing efforts on smaller aircraft. The Soviets had requested some of their own B-29, but these requests were ignored. Even so, just 3 years later Russia was debuting the Tu-4 bomber at an air show in Moscow. To any westerner observer, it appeared to be a carbon copy of the B-29.

It turns out that the Soviets had received everything that they needed to reverse engineer the B-29 bomber since July 29th, 1944 when an intact B-29 was damaged and forced to land in Vladivostok. In the end four of the U.S. aircrafts had fallen into Soviet hands either by emergency landing or salvaged parts from a crash. The Russian scientists, engineers, and technicians were able to quickly reverse engineer an entire bomber and put it into production. And even while the Tu-4 never made a significant impact in the war efforts, it definitely shocked the United States to see that the Russians had successfully reverse engineered a powerful weapon developed by the United States.

There are countless examples of reverse engineering throughout history albeit by different names like theft, or copying. Reverse engineering on its own is harmless but you can see how someone might take that knowledge and use it in a self-serving way.

As time progressed, technology became more complex and inventions were built on abstractions of electronics to enable developers. At the advent of software a new invention to figure out presented itself and with it came its own set of challenges. Early on developers basically had to write machine code that was very explicit in the way it would operate the transistor logic subsystems. Now software has been built on top of the machine code to greatly simplify common procedures with new tools.
